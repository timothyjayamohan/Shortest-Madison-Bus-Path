# Shortest-Madison-Bus-Path
This project utilizes the Dijkstra algorithm to compute the shortest path from a user picked list of bus stops the user wants to travel to. Each stop represents one node within the graph and the distance between bus stops in real life determines the weight of each edge. The user will be able to load any DOT graph file and compute the distance between a chosen start and end point.

Backend Functionality Description:
The backend will interact closely with the Data Wrangler’s code and the Algorithm Engineer’s code in order to create a unified class that can load, manipulate, and find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
